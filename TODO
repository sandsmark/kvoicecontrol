KvoiceControl TODO-list
=======================

General:
- source code documentation
- save options -> see BUGS/PROBLEMS
- i18n
- icons etc.
- store low resolution wave along with preprocessed utterance 
  (saves memory but enables to implement a double-click-to-replay function in ReferenceEditor
- lock screen should disallow KVoiceControl from accepting input

Sound card:
- Mixer program (kmix) does not work on some notebooks

Preprocessing:
- amplitude normalization (?)

Recognizer:
- improved rejection of non-speech input signals


BUGS/PROBLEMS:
- up to now, one can interact with the program while it is recording;
  this can lead to problems, but can simply be avoided by behaving
  "non-destructively" ;-)
- save options is implemented but not yet working ?!

(HOPEFULLY) FIXED BUGS
- some people complained about the object dialog not popping up correctly 
  (it's about 5 pixels high)
- sound card should have well-defined initial status now. This should avoid messages
  like (can't open soundcard: Device or resource busy)
- some sound driver's didn't show mic level properly in calibration dialog. This
  should be fixed now!
