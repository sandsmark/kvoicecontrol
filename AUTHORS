Thanks to all those people who send me comments on the program. I especially 
appreciate the constructive criticism that I receive. A special thank you goes to

Gerd Knorr <kraxel@goldbach.in-berlin.de> (Author of krecord)
some sound driver's didn't show mic level properly in calibration dialog.
This should be fixed now thanks to Gerd's help!

Marcus <Suran@gmx.net>
utterance lists can be organized in a tree structure now (release 0.16).
This allows for creating a simple "grammar structure"!

Andreas F. Pour <pour@mieterra.com>
several patch contributions and constant constructive criticism.
